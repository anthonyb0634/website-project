            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">It all started in my elementary school. I tried out for the team in the fourth grade and did not make the cut. That really got to me. So I played basketball hoping to make the team on 5th grade. I probably would of made the team but my grades were bad so I couldn't try out, that was when I learned my lesson about grades and school work.</p>

            <p class="card-text">When I got my acceptance letter it had told me that I had been accepted to Highschool of Telecommunications of Art and Technology, also known as Telecom. The home of the yellow jackets. My freshman year I had made the cut to the Junior Varsity Basketball team. I was so nervous since it was my first time being in a official organized basketball team. Everytime that my coach had tried to put me in the game I would turn it over. I averaged 0.9 points, 0.4 assists the whole season and we went 1-9 in the regular season. I was lacking in confidence to continue playing after that, so I put in hours everyday throughout the summer.</p>

            <p class="card-text">My Sophomore year during the time I had in JV my second year I averaged 8 points per game and I lead the league in assists. I got moved up to the Varsity Basketball team mid-way through my JV season. The difference between the Varsity level players and Junior Varsity was not expected but luckily I tend to step up to better competition and I was known as the best on ball defender on the team. I usually guarded the best player on the other team unless if it was a center. It wasn’t easy and sometimes I had bad games. Now I wasn’t a main scorer on the tean usually the 4th option but if I did what I had to do we usually won. Even though we didnt go far in the playoffs I learned alot from my coach.</p>

Theres nothing like having a dream and chasing it. Now I know my journey is not done. But if I can help someone see things the way I do I beileve they can go far.</p>
